# LAN party RSVP app

This is an AppEngine app that I wrote in 2012 and use to manage RSVPs for LAN parties.

(I have this, house, see... http://kentonshouse.com)

This app probably isn't useful to anyone other than me.

I used AppEngine mostly because I was a Google employee when I wrote this. Today, I would have used [Meteor](https://meteor.com), and deployed on [Sandstorm](https://sandstorm.io).

The code is an Eclipse App Engine project (use the Google App Engine Eclipse plugin).

Note that the directory war/WEB-INF/lib/ in the source tree needs to be manually populated with the necessary jar files. The files needed are listed in war/WEB-INF/lib/files.txt -- they should be findable via Google.
