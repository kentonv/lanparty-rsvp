# LAN party RSVP app

This is an AppEngine app that I wrote in 2012 and use to manage RSVPs for LAN parties.

(I have this, house, see... http://kentonshouse.com)

This app probably isn't useful to anyone other than me.

I used AppEngine mostly because I was a Google employee when I wrote this. Today, I would have used [Meteor](https://meteor.com), and deployed on [Sandstorm](https://sandstorm.io).
